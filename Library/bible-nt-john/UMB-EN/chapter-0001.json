		"38": "And Jesus turned and saw them following Him. He asked them, \"What are you seeking?\" They said, \"Rabbi (which means 'Teacher'), where are you staying?\" ",
		"39": "He replied, \"Come, and you will see.\" So they went and saw where He was staying. They stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.\r\n",
		"40": "\tAndrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John speak, and followed Jesus. ",
		"41": "The first thing he did was find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means 'Christ'). ",
