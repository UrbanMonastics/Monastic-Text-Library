		"16": "\tHe came to Nazareth, where he grew up. As he had been doing, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.",

		"18": "\"The spirit of the Lord is upon me,\r\nbecause he has anointed me\r\nto proclaim good news to the poor.\r\nHe has sent me to proclaim liberty for the captives,\r\nand recovery of sight for the blind,\r\nand to set the oppressed free.\r\n",
		"19": "To proclaim the year of the LORD's favor.\"\r\n\r\n",
