	"Text": "[II] Praise and glory to Christ. Through Him all are able to come into the presence of God, who lives forever, and intercedes for us. Trusting in this through faith we ask:\r\n[IR] Remember your people, Lord.\r\n[I1] As our day draws to a close, we call to you, Sun of justice, for all people,\r\n[I2] may all enjoy your eternal light without end.\r\n[I1] Keep the covenant that you have consecrated by your divine blood,\r\n[I2] and sanctify your Church, that she might exist without blemish. \r\n[I1] Remember, Lord, your congregations,\r\n[I2] as a place where you dwell.\r\n[I1] Guide us upon the narrow path. The way of happiness and peace,\r\n[I2] that takes us to our desired goal of joy and salvation.\r\n[I1] Welcome, Lord, the souls of the deceased,\r\n[I2] grant them your forgiveness and everlasting glory.",
