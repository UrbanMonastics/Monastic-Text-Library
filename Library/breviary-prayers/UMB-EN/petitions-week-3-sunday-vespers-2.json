	"Text": "[II] The cosmos once created by God, He has brought restoration through redemption, and he continually renews creation through His love. Trusting in his eternal love we ask:\r\n[IR] Lord, renew the wondrous works of your love. \r\n[I1] We thank you God for you reveal your power in all of creation,\r\n[I2] you reveal your providence within the course of history.\r\n[I1] Through your Son, who preaches a gospel of peace, and was victorious on the cross,\r\n[I2] deliver us from baseless fear and despair.\r\n[I1] Provide to everyone that loves and practices justice,\r\n[I2] a faithful cooperation in the building of a world where true peace reigns.\r\n[I1] Be present with the oppressed, deliver the captives, comfort the poor, feed the hungry, grant strength to the weak,\r\n[I2] reveal in all things the victory of the cross.\r\n[I1] After his death and burial, you wonderfully raised your Son to glory,\r\n[I2] grant that the deceased may join Him in eternal life.",
