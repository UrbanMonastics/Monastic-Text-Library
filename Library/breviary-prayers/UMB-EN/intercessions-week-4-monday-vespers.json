We humbly come before you:\r\n[IR] Our God, Hear us.\r\n[I1] Lord Jesus Christ, our light, illuminate your Church,\r\n[I2] that she may proclaim to all nations, the great mystery of our faith, that was manifested in your flesh. \r\n[I1] Watch over the ministers and leaders of your Church,\r\n[I2] so that they may faithfully proclaim the truth to all people.\r\n[I1] By your blood, you have given peace to the world,\r\n[I2] help us let go of sin that divides us, and end the scourge of war.\r\n[I1] Out of the abundance of your grace sustain the marriages of our siblings in Christ,\r\n[I2] may their unions more perfectly reflect the mystery of your Church.\r\n[I1] Grant to all who have passed the forgiveness of their sins,\r\n[I2] by your mercy, may they live joyously among the saints.",
