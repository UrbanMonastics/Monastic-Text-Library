Pray to Him, together with sincerity:\r\n[IR] Lord, hear our prayer.\r\n[I1] Lord and Father of all, who has sent your Son into the world, that your name might be glorified everywhere,\r\n[I2] strengthen the testimony of your Church among the nations.\r\n[I1] May the Apostles preaching easily instruct us,\r\n[I2] to conform our lives to the truth of our faith.\r\n[I1] You, who love the righteous,\r\n[I2] do right for those suffering injustice.\r\n[I1] Deliver the captives, give sight to the blind,\r\n[I2] rebuild the shattered, and care for the migrants.\r\n[I1] Fulfill the promise for those who now sleep in your peace,\r\n[I2] that through your Son they will come to the holy resurrection.",
