We join together and play our part, when we cry with exultation:\r\n[IR] Lord, Your kingdom come.\r\n[I1] Our savior, continue to make Your Church the living sacrament of unity for people,\r\n[I2] and the mystery of salvation to all nations and times.\r\n[I1] As our High Priest, always help those leading Your universal Church,\r\n[I2] giving to them the gifts of unity, charity, and peace.\r\n[I1] Help all Christians remain closely united to You as our divine Head,\r\n[I2] may we proclaim Your Kingdom by the testimony of our lives.\r\n[I1] Grant peace to the world,\r\n[I2] so calm and safety may flourish in all places.\r\n[IXtra]\r\n[I1] Give the glory of the final resurrection to the deceased,\r\n[I2] and share with us from the overflowing of their blessings.",
