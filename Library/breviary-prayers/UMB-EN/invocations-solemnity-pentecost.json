We implore Him with firm hope:\r\n[IR] Renew, Lord, the face of creation.\r\n[I1] Lord Jesus, who, being exalted on the cross, poured from your side rivers of living water,\r\n[I2] send your Spirit who gives us life.\r\n[I1] You, who, are glorified at the right hand of God, have given to the disciples the gift of the Father,\r\n[I2] send your Spirit to renew the world.\r\n[I1] You, who, gave the Apostles power from your Spirit to overcome sin,\r\n[I2] send your Spirit to destroy sin throughout creation.\r\n[I1] You, who, promised the Holy Spirit would teach us all things and remind us of all that you have said:\r\n[I2] send your Spirit to illuminate our faith.\r\n[I1] You, Who, promised to send the Spirit of truth to witness about you,\r\n[I2] send your Spirit to make us faithful witnesses.",
