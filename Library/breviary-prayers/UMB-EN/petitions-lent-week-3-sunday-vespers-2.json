Let us ask together in Faith.\r\n[IR]Lord, show favor to your people.\r\n[I1]Hear us, merciful God, the prayers which we offer in favor for all your people,\r\n[I2]that we prefer the satisfaction of your word rather than bread.\r\n[I1]Teach us, all who are inclined to love, to have an effective and genuine love for your creation and for all people without exception.\r\n[I2]Building towards everlasting good will and peace.\r\n[I1]Look at all those regenerated by baptism,\r\n[I2]consecrate them to yourself, making them living stones in the temple of your Spirit.\r\n[I1]That many, in the way of Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites, repent in their youth.\r\n[I2]By your word, touch and convert their hearts.\r\n[I1]Grant the dying to go with hope to meet Christ their judge,\r\n[I2]and to enjoy your presence forever.",
