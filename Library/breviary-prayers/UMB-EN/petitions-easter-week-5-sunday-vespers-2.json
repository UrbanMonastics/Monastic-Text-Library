He now lives and intercedes for us.\r\n[IR]Victorious King, hear our prayer.\r\n[I1]Christ you are the light of the world, and the salvation of nations;\r\n[I2]set us on fire with your Spirit as we proclaim the wonder of your resurrection.\r\n[I1]Let Israel see in you the Messiah they have longed for;\r\n[I2]fill everyone who has breath with the knowledge of your glory.\r\n[I1]Keep us as one, in communion, with your saints;\r\n[I2]may we find rest with them when the work of our lives are done.\r\n[I1]You, Jesus, have destroyed death, the final enemy of us all;\r\n[I2]now destroy within us all that keeps us from God.\r\n[I1]Christ, our Savior, you became obedient to death, are exalted at the right hand of the Father;\r\n[I2]receive our siblings into the kingdom of your glory.",
