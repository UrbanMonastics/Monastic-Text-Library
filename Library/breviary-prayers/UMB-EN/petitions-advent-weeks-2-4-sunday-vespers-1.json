	"Text": "[II] Beloved siblings, let us humbly implore Christ the Lord, born of the Virgin Mary, and let us call on Him with joy:\r\n[IR] Come, Lord Jesus!\r\n[I1] Only Son of God, who is coming to be the true messenger of the Covenant,\r\n[I2] grant that creation welcomes and recognizes You.\r\n[I1] You who was begotten within the Father's bosom, You took on flesh from the Virgin Mary,\r\n[I2] cleanse us of the corruption of our human condition.\r\n[I1] You who are life, came to endure death,\r\n[I2] spare us from the terrors of our deaths.\r\n[I1] And since your gift of salvation awaits us at the Judgement, might your constant tenderness be given us until then,\r\n[I1] And Your gift of salvation awaits us at the Judgement, let Your constant tenderness be given today,\r\n[I2] which gives relief to us for all our remaining days.\r\n[I1] Lord Christ, by dying you helped all the dead,\r\n[I2] we pray you welcome the deceased with tenderness.",
