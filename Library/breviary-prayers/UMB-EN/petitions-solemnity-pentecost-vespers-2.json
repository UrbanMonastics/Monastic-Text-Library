With joy let us pray, saying:\r\n[IR] Send your Holy Spirit onto the Church!\r\n[I1] You want to gather, through one baptism in the Spirit, all those who exhault the name of Christ,\r\n[I2] grant believers to be of one heart and one soul.\r\n[I1] You who desire the Spirit to fill the world,\r\n[I2] help all people build justice and peace within creation.\r\n[I1] Lord God, Father of all, you want to gather together all your scattered children, in unity of faith,\r\n[I2] illuminating the universe by the grace of the Holy Spirit.\r\n[I1] By your Spirit, you renew all things,\r\n[I2] heal the sick, comfort the afflicted, and to all, give salvation.\r\n[I1] By the Spirit, you raised your Son from the dead,\r\n[I2] likewise, raise our bodies from dust to eternal life.",
