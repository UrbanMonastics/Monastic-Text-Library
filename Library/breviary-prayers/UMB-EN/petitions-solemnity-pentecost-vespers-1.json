	"Text": "[II] Let us exalt and praise our God. On the day of Pentecost, He filled the Apostles with the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. We implore You with joy, and all our hearts:\r\n[IR] Send Your Spirit and renew creation.\r\n[I1] In the beginning, You created the heavens and the earth. In the fullness of time You will restore all things through Christ,\r\n[I2] by Your saving Spirit, refresh the face of creation.\r\n[I1] You breathed into Adam and Eve the breath of life,\r\n[I2] send Your Spirit into the Church, so that, living through the Spirit, she may constantly be rejuvenated and give life to the world.\r\n[I1] Enlighten all by the light of Your Spirit, and drive away the darkness of our time,\r\n[I2] that hatred may be transformed into love, our sorrows into joys, and wars into lasting peace.\r\n[I1] Quench everyones thirst with the water of Your Spirit, flowing from the side of Christ,\r\n[I2] may He free creation from every evils that harms. \r\n[I1] By Your Holy Spirit, You bring us into life and glory,\r\n[I2] through Him, allow the deceased to taste the joys of Your love in Your Kingdom.",
