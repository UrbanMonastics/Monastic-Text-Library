	"Text": "[II] Let us pray with confidence to our Savior. To Him who was miraculously transfigured on the mountain. In the sight of the disciples:\r\n[IR] Illuminate our darkness, You our God!\r\n[I1] Christ, with your transfiguration, you revealed to the disciples your resurrection before you climbed your cross. We pray to you for your holy Church, which is struggling in the world:\r\n[I2] in its failures, may it be transfigured by the joy of your victory.\r\n[I1] Christ, who took Peter, James, and John with him. He led them up a tall mountain alone. We pray to you for the leaders of your Church:\r\n[I2] that they minister to your people with the hope of the resurrection.\r\n[I1] Christ, who upon that mountain shone your face upon Moses and Elijah. We pray to you for all who have not known the illumination of your word and way:\r\n[I2] that they may share with us in the fullness of redemption.\r\n[I1] Christ, who illuminated the earth when the glory of the Creator arose upon you. We pray to you for all who are transforming bad into good:\r\n[I2] that they may walk in your light.\r\n[I1] Christ, who will transform our humble bodies into bodies of glory. We pray for our siblings who have left this life before us:\r\n[I2] that they may enter into your glory.",
