		"3": "\t\"And the owner went out around the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, ",
		"4": "and told them, 'You go into my vineyard also, and I will pay you whatever is right.' And so they went.\"\r\n",
		"5": "\t\"Again, the owner went around the sixth and ninth hours and did the same. ",
		"6": "And around the eleventh hour they went out and found others standing around. So they asked them, 'Why have you  been standing here all day doing nothing?'\"\r\n",
		"7": "\"They responded to him, 'because no one hired us.'\"\r\n\t\"The owner said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'\"\r\n",
		"8": "\t\"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last and to the first.'\"\r\n",
		"9": "\t\"The workers hired around the eleventh hour came up, each one received a denarius. ",

		"11": "When they received their wage they grumbled at the landowner. ",
		"12": "Saying, 'Those who were hired last worked only one hour. And you made them equal to us who borne the burden of the day's work with its sweltering heat.'\"\r\n",
		"13": "\t\"But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am not doing wrong by you, did you not agree to work for a denarius?",
		"14": "Take what is yours and go. I want to give to those hired last the same as you. ",
		"15": "Is it not my right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'\"\r\n",
		"16": "\t\"So the last will be first, and the first will be last.\""
