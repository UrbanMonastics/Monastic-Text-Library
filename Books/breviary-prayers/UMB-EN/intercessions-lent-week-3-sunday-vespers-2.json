Let us ask together in Faith\r\n\t*Lord, show favor to your people*\r\nHear us, merciful God, the prayers which we offer in favor for all your people,\r\n\t— **That we prefer the satisfaction of your word rather than bread.**\r\nTeach us, all who are inclined to love, to have an effective and genuine love for your creation and for all people without exception.\r\n\t— **Building towards everlasting good will and peace.**\r\nLook at all those regenerated by baptism,\r\n\t— **Consecrate them to yourself, making them living stones in the temple of your Spirit.**\r\nThat many, in the way of Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites, repent in their youth,\r\n\t— **by your word, touch and convert their hearts.**\r\n\t*(Lord, show favor to your people)*\r\nGrant the dying to go with hope to meet Christ their judge,\r\n\t— **and to enjoy your presence forever. **"
