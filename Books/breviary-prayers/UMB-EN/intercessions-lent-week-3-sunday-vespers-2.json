Let us ask together in Faith\r\n\t*Lord, show favor to your people*\r\n[L]Hear us, merciful God, the prayers which we offer in favor for all your people,\r\n[T]That we prefer the satisfaction of your word rather than bread.\r\n[L]Teach us, all who are inclined to love, to have an effective and genuine love for your creation and for all people without exception.\r\n[T]Building towards everlasting good will and peace.\r\nLook at all those regenerated by baptism,\r\n[T]Consecrate them to yourself, making them living stones in the temple of your Spirit.**\r\nThat many, in the way of Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites, repent in their youth,\r\n[T]by your word, touch and convert their hearts.**\r\n[T]Lord, show favor to your people\r\n[L}Grant the dying to go with hope to meet Christ their judge,\r\n[T]and to enjoy your presence forever. **"
