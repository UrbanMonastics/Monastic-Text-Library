Let us pray to him:\r\n[IR]By your victory, save your people, Lord.\r\n[I1]Christ, by your victory you have broken the gates of hell, destroying sin and death,\r\n[I2]make us victorious today over sin.\r\n[I1]You, who have destroyed death grant to us new life,\r\n[I2]give us the grace and strength to walk in this renewed life.\r\n[I1]You gave life to the long lost and bring all people from death back to life,\r\n[I2]give to your children eternal life.\r\n
[I1]You, who confounded the keepers of your tomb, filled your disciples with joy,\r\n[I2]grant us, your servants, the fulness of joy."
